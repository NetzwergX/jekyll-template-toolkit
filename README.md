[Jekyll Boilerstrap â†—](http://teumert.net/jekyll-template-toolkit/)
====================================================================

A widget collection for vanilla jekyll, 100% compatible to 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Jekyll-Boilerstrap (J-BS) is the sucessor to Jekyll-Template-Toolkit (JTT). It is
partially inspired by Jekyll-Bootstrap and aims at providing a solid alternative
since Jekyll-Bootstrap is not longer actively developed. The goal of Jekyll
Boilerstrap is to provide a quick start into blogging with Jekyll, without
much hassle, so that the blogger can focus on creating content instead of
building a working page.

Jekyll-Boilerstrap delivers boilerplate templates for the use with Jekyll,
without using any plugins, therefore sites using Jekyll-Boilerstrap can be
pushed directly to GitHub and will be build automatically.

Jekyll-Boilerstraps templates are furthermore compatible with Twitter-Bootstrap,
and using Twitter-Bootstrap is highly recommended.

Optionally, use of those thrid party tools is recommended and natively
supported by Jekyll-Boilerstrap:

* JQuery
* HTML5Shiv
* Font-Awesome
* Link-Awesome

Furthermore, Jekyll-Boilerstrap uses semantic HTML5 and marks up microdata
using the schema.org microdata vocabulary.


Current state
-------------

The `jekyll-boilerstrap` will always contain the latest stable release.
As of now, it is subject to **heavy and rapid changes**. Once Jekyll-Boilerstrap
1.0.0 is released, new versions will be developed in `jbs-X.X.X-WIP` branches.
Once those branches are stable, they will be merged into `jekyll-boilerstrap`
and be appropriately tagged. There is no `master`-branch to ease the use of J-BS
with project pages.
