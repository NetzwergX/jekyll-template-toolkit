=============================

*** This is the WIP branch for Jekyll 1.0 compatible templates ***
		
	
Contribution (Code of conduct)
------------------------------

**Contribution is highly encouraged**. If you think you found a great piece code that is useful
for jekyll users, feel free to contribute!

There are some rules though:
	
* Do not spam-commit. Use a sensible # of commits.
* Split logical changes into separate commits, avoid gigantic commits.
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Avoid lines with more then 100 characters wherever possible.
* Use **tabs** for indentation, spaces for alignment.
* Do not harm anyone while using or contributing to this software
