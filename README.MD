Jekyll Template Toolkit (JTT)
=============================

A widget collection for vanilla jekyll, 100% compatible to github-pages.

All widgets work in a vanilla jekyll installation, ensuring that a site that is built with these 
templates can also sucessfully be built on GitHub. This makes JTT a very useful toolkit for the use
with GitHub Pages.

You can confirm this locally by running
	
		jekyll --safe

Each widget is a self-contained piece of code that can simply be included via 

	{% include widgets/widget.html %}. 
	
There are also some predefined boilerplate pages and layouts that make the day-to-day work with 
jekyll much easier. feel free to use and adapt them for your own blog.

The HTML markup used in all files is HTML5. I tried to use it as semantically correct as possible.
If you find any mistakes, please open an issue or fork & submit a pull request as fix.
